Mastermind Game
A two-player game where one player acts as the codemaker and the other as the codebreaker. The objective of the codebreaker is to guess the code generated by the codemaker within ten attempts.

Game Play
1. The codebreaker inputs the length of the code (n) and the range of digits (m).
2. The codemaker generates a random code of length n, with each digit ranging from 0 to m-1.
3. The codebreaker inputs a guess, a sequence of n digits.
4. The codemaker provides feedback on the guess, indicating the number of digits that are the right digit in the right location and the number of digits  that are the right digit in the wrong location.
5. The codebreaker continues to guess the code until either the correct code is guessed or the maximum number of attempts (10) has been reached.

Winning the Game
The game is won by the codebreaker if they correctly guess the code in ten or fewer attempts. Otherwise, the codemaker wins. The feedback from the codemaker provides information to the codebreaker to refine their guesses and improve their chances of winning the game.

Note
The code and the guess should not contain any duplicates, and each digit in the code or guess should only be counted once.
